Breathing Guide by Lilju
========================

A simple breathing guide app which I made to practice my frontend skills, you can install it on your device as it is a PWA (Progressive Web App). I had this idea when I composed the track 'Along a sparkling spring' for my relaxation album 'Celloscapes' but didn't know anything about code.

It made me practice responsive design, css animations, javascript, glassmorphism, taught me how to make a favicon, how to simply translate with JS and how to create a PWA (Progressive Web App).
